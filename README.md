Hi, I'm Carlos Pascual García. I am a researcher in Quantum Information Theory from a theoretical perspective.

My experience is mainly concerned with numerical methods for quantum technologies, mainly focused on conic
programming, and the development of improvements in optimization algorithms like facial reduction. I'm 
currently interested in improving my research using genetic algorithms and deep learning. 

On the other hand, I look forward to applying my expertise to new challenges in other fields, such as
quantum hardware design and quantitative finance, and I'm carrying personal projects in
other languages like Rust.


If you are interested in my reseach or feel I could help you somehow, you may reach me through LinkedIn
(Carlos Pascual-García) or my official e-mail (carlos.pascual@luxquanta.com)
