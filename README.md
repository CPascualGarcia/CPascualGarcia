Hi, I'm Carlos Pascual García. I am a researcher in quantum information from a theoretical perspective.

My experience is mainly concerned with analytical methods for quantum continuous variables (in particular
for quantum communications) as well as semidefinite programming with algorithms such
as Frank-Wolfe, and different improvements like facial reduction and regularization techniques. 

I'm currently interested in improving my research using genetic algorithms and JIT compilation. On the
other hand, I endeavor to apply my expertise to new challenges in continuous variable quantum computing.

If you are interested in my reseach or feel I could help you somehow, you may reach me through LinkedIn
(Carlos Pascual García) or my official e-mail (carlos.pascual@icfo.eu)
