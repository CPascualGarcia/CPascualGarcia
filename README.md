Hi, I'm Carlos Pascual García. I am a researcher in Quantum Information Theory from a theoretical perspective.

My experience is mainly concerned with analytical methods for quantum continuous variables (in particular
for Quantum Communications) as well as semidefinite programming and generic conic programming. This includes
the analysis of statistical deviations for finite statistics in Quantum Key Distribution, and the development
of improvements in interior point algorithms like facial reduction. 

I'm currently interested in improving my research using genetic algorithms and Julia compilation. On the
other hand, I endeavor to apply my expertise to new challenges in other fields, as continuous variable quantum computing
or energetic efficiency for Quantum Communications.

If you are interested in my reseach or feel I could help you somehow, you may reach me through LinkedIn
(Carlos Pascual García) or my official e-mail (carlos.pascual@icfo.eu)
