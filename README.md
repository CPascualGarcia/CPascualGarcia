Hi, I'm Carlos Pascual García. I am a researcher in Quantum Information Theory from a theoretical perspective.

My experience is mainly concerned with analytical methods for quantum continuous variables as well as semidefinite
programming and generic conic programming. This includes the analysis of statistical deviations due to finite-size
effects in quantum key distribution, and the development of improvements in optimization algorithms like facial reduction. 

I'm currently interested in improving my research using genetic algorithms, machine learning and Julia compilation. 
On the other hand, I look forward to applying my expertise to new challenges in other fields, as (continuous variable)
quantum computing or energetic efficiency for quantum technologies.

If you are interested in my reseach or feel I could help you somehow, you may reach me through LinkedIn
(Carlos Pascual García) or my official e-mail (carlos.pascual@icfo.eu)
